I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of History at the State University of New York at Binghamton. Being trained in ancient Chinese history and Chinese classics, I am currently focusing on Chinese borderland in late imperial and early twentieth-century China. The topic of my research will center on the complex interactions between environment, technologies, and state-building in the borderlands of northern China during this period.
